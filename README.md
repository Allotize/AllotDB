# AllotDB
This project aims to be replacement for [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API),
where focus is on performance at the loss of persistence.
As AllotDB is made to be used in decentralized systems, the persistence sacrifice is
well-worth it, as persistence can be enforced via our peers instead.
